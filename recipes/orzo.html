    <h3>A twist on the classic Risotto. We use Orzo pasta in place of rice.</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>8oz of dried Orzo</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Beef Better Than Bouillon</li>
        <li>4 cups of water, beef, or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded parmesan</li>
        <li>Salt, Garlic Powder, Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix your beef Better Than Boillon in 4 cups of water or unsalted broth. Microwave for 4 minutes. Your stock doesn't have to be <strong>hot</strong> but it should not be cold. You do not want to cool down your pan everytime you add stock to the orzo.</li>
        <li>Pre-heat pan on medium-high. When hot, add olive oil and orzo to pan. Sautee your orzo for 1 minute. Continuously move orzo during this step.</li>
        <li>Add 2 cups of your warm broth to the pan. Mix to evenly distribute liquid. <strong>Note:</strong> It is not necessary to constantly stir your risotto, despite what you have heard online. The most important thing is that you do not let your pan run completely dry.</li>
        <li>Occasionally stir your orzo to see if it needs more liquid. If, when you drag a spoon or plastic spatula through the center of the pan, you notice no more free liquid in the pan, you need to add another cup of stock.</li>
        <li>It may require less than 4 cups of stock to fully cook your orzo. Taste your food. When the orzo is soft, it is done cooking and you can stop adding liquid.</li>
        <li>Turn off the stove and remove pan from heat. Stir in the butter and shredded parmesan. Add salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste.</li>
    </ol>
